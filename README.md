# MindNode2Essay

In my high school English classes, we are requried to write essays with strict&clear structures (Intro-Body-Conlusion, Point-Evidence-Explanation...). The way I always do is using MindNode. In this way, I can easily visualize my stcuture and correctly weight and revise each part.

But, after finishing wrting the draft, copying each part into a Pages file, in order to print it in the correct format, is just time-wasting, especially when you wrote a long essay with many points. 

Therefore, I wrote this mini converter to convert a plain text file, exported from MindNode (or any other MindMap editors), into another plain text file that only includes your "Essay part" in the mindmap.

# How-to

`python3 main.py [filename]` 

The exported file is named `EssayDraft.txt`
